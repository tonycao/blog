I am using LaTex and SublimeText to create slides for my thesis proposal. The feature I need is spell check.

After searching on google, I found that the spell check is allowed in SublimeText. 

You can enable spell check by either:

	1. go to -> Main menu bar -> Preferences -> Settings - User

	add the following and save,
	{
		"spell_check":true
	}

	2. F6 or go to -> View->'Spell Check'. 


Enjoy spell check in SublimeText.
